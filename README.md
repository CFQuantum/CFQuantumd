# ReadMe

CF enhanced blockchain, and aims to build a platform to provide common blockchain smart contract services. 

As a fledgling technology, existing blockchain implementations have fallen short of meeting the multitude of requirements inherent in the complex world of business transactions. Scalability challenges, and the lack of support for confidential and private transactions, among other limitations, make its use unworkable for many business critical applications. In order for the platform to be resilient to time and support requirements across the industries, it needs to be lightweight, modular and support extensibility through configuration and plug ability of various components (transaction validators, block consensus etc.).

CF derives from IBM fabric (https://github.com/CFQuantum/fabric).
